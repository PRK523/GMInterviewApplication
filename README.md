# Architecture: MVC
GitHub Api that is used in this project is a Public Api to fetch the appropriate JSON response.
URL: https://api.github.com/repos/eficode/weatherapp/commits
But you can also use my personal github api for my repo: https://api.github.com/repos/PRK523/GitHubApi/commits

Have added appropriate unit tests for testing the business logic of my code.
Use of URLSession to download data from the URL's endpoints. 
Use of Codable protocol in Swift to encode and decode data formats, such as JSON, to native Swift objects.
